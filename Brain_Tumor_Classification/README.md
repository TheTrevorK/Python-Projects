Brain Tumor Classification using Keras Machine Learning Model

Overview: This repository contains a deep learning model implemented in Keras for the classification of brain tumors based on medical images. The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans to predict whether a given scan contains a tumor or not. This project aims to assist in the early detection of brain tumors through the use of machine learning techniques.
